ABOUT_MESSAGE = This calculator is by unitEd. This is a four-function calculator with some extra features including the ability to inverse a function as well as evaluate an integer exponent. This calculator will not let you type units into the input bar; you must select one from the dropdown menu. Additionally, it will change languages based on your locality but is currently limited to English, French, and Spanish-speaking localities. The  calculator shows all previous calculations in the history display to the right and shows the steps of those calculations in the intermediate steps displayed on the left.
